🎯 Project Update: Git Commit AI

After seeing countless "fix bug" and "update code" commits in my career, I decided to solve this problem with AI.

I just launched Git Commit AI - a VS Code extension that analyzes your code changes and generates meaningful commit messages automatically.

🔹 Built with TypeScript
🔹 Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and local AI
🔹 Open source and free to use
🔹 Already helping developers save time

This was a great learning experience in:
• VS Code Extension API
• AI integration (GPT-4/Claude)
• TypeScript development
• Developer tooling

### 5. **Hacker News**

**Title:** "Show HN: Git Commit AI – VS Code extension that writes commit messages with AI"

**Description:**
```
Hi HN! I built a VS Code extension that uses AI to generate commit messages by analyzing your git diff.

The problem: We all know we should write good commit messages, but it's tedious and we often just write "fix stuff" or "update code".

The solution: Click one button, AI reads your changes, generates a proper conventional commit message.

Features:
- Multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama for local/free)
- Learns from your commit history for consistency
- Conventional Commits format by default
- Simple or detailed styles available

It's open source and free to use. The code analysis happens via git diff, so it's language-agnostic.

Would love your feedback on the approach and what features would make this more useful!
